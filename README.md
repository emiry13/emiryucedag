# Liquid Glass Demo

A minimal Vite + React setup using your files.

## Run locally

1) Install Node.js 18+  
2) In this folder, run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite will print a `Local` URL (typically http://localhost:5173). Open it in **Chrome, Edge, or another Chromium-based browser**.

> The effect depends on Chromium-specific behavior (see `App.tsx` comment). It may not work in Safari/Firefox.

## Images

This project references images like `/images/AS11-40-5865HR.webp`.  
Place your files in `public/images/` and make sure the filenames match, or edit `src/App.tsx` to point to images that exist.

## Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
